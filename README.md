# Multi-threaded-Racing-Game-CPS-356
This project implements a simple racing game that demonstrates the principles of multi-threading in programming. In the game, two cars represented on a 2D grid move concurrently toward a finish line with each running in its own thread. The threads run independently, simulating real-time movement and competition. 

The project highlights:
Concurrent execution using multiple threads
Synchronization and race conditions
Real-time updates and thread management
